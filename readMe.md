# OneQuery

Work with datasets (arrays of objects) in fluent fashion -- similar to c# linq method syntax, though in many ways more pleasant. Query datasets composed from regular javascript, from indexedDb, or mix them using the same API. A future goal is to allow this to work with server-side persistence (such as Postgre or Mongo) in the same way it works with indexedDb.
