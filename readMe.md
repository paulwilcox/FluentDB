# FluentDB

Work with datasets (arrays of objects) in fluent fashion -- similar to c# linq method syntax, though in many ways more pleasant. Query datasets composed from regular javascript, from indexedDb, from mongoDb, or mix them using the same API. 

Visit the project wiki [here](https://github.com/paulwilcox/FluentDB/wiki) to learn how to work with FluentDB, what it can do, and to see the roadmap.
