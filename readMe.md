# LISH (linq-ish)

Work with data structures in regular javascript and indexedDb using the same API.  Intermingling Javascript and indexedDb is possible.

A ***data structure*** is an array of objects with named properties.

***Operations*** include joins, mergings, filters, mappings, orderings, groupings, foldings (aggregations), visualizations and similar operations.

Inspired by c# linq method syntax, but quite different: it's linq-ish, or 'lish'.

## Usage

## Goals

- Future work on lish will seek to use the same API to work with a server database from node.

- I may want to create a simple charting capacity to go along with the current table visualizations.

- This code needs more work before it will be ready for a production environment.
