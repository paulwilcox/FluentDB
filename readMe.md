# oneQuery

Work with data structures in regular javascript and indexedDb using the same API.  Intermingling Javascript and indexedDb is possible.

A ***data structure*** is an array of objects with named properties.

***Operations*** include joins, mergings, filters, mappings, orderings, groupings, foldings (aggregations), visualizations and similar operations.

Future work will seek to use the same API to work with a server database from node.

Inspired by c# linq method syntax, but quite different.
